    "The main objective of a pharmaceutical research is to find a new drug inorder to cure a specific disease. Structure-based approaches in drug design develop drugs with respect to a target protein which is associated with the disease under investigation. However, in order to develop such a drug it is crucial to know where the drug is supposed to bind in the protein and therefore inhibit or activate the protein. Not always such a small molecule binding site is known. Therefore it is important to have tools for binding site detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binding site detection has a special mention in the process of drug development. Binding sites are defined as a **hollow 3 dimensional space** on the surface of a protein molecule, which serves as the region for **ligand**, **peptide**, or **protein** binding.

    "    * Example: Docking\n",

    "    * In this method, a scoring function is incorporated to evaluate the fragments that are placed at a position on the protein surface.\n",
    "    * Scoring functions are physics based, which uses Molecular Mechanics force fields, which primarily estimates the amount of affinity between the binding ligand and the protein.\n",
    "    * The scoring functions calculates the feasibilty of whether the ligand could be docked to the particular protein\n",

The classification helps us of an all-encompassing binding site of 85 residues. It is possible to compare the **interaction patterns** of **kinase-inhibitors** to each other to, for example, identify crucial interactions determining kinase-inhibitor selectivity. Therefore this could be an ideal method used for the validation of the obtained binding site. "
