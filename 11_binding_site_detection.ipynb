    "The main objective of a pharmaceutical research is to find a new drug inorder to cure a specific disease. Structure-based approaches in drug design, develop drugs with respect to a target protein which is associated with the disease under investigation. However, in order to develop such a drug it is crucial to know where the drug is supposed to bind in the protein and therefore inhibit or activate the protein. Not always such a small molecule binding site is known and therefore it is important to have tools for binding site detection.\n",

    "Pocket detection has a special mention in the process of drug prediction. Pockets are a **hollow 3 dimensional space** on the surface of a protein molecule, which serves as the region for **ligand**, **peptide**, or **protein** binding. There are various factors which determine the presence of pocket in 3 dimensional space of a protein:\n",

Pocket volume and surface are calculated by counting the **grid points** constituting the pocket volume or its surface and multiplying this number with the grid box volume or surface, respectively.
