    "The ultimate goal in pharmaceutical research is to find a novel drug against a specific disease. Pocket detection, has a special mention in the process of drug prediction. Pockets are a **hollow 3 dimensional space** on the surface of a protein molecule, which serves as the region for **ligand** and **protein** binding. There are various factors which determines the presence of a pocket in a 3 dimensional space in a protein. This may depend upon the following factors.\n",

    "* **Fpocket :** Fpocket stands for \"Finding Pocket\". The pocket detection package based on Voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres. Fpocket core can be resumed by three major steps. (!!It is a grid free based method and it is energy and geometry based method)\n",
    "    * <i>Step 1:</i> The whole ensemble of alpha spheres is determined from the protein structure. Fpocket returns a   pre-filtered collection of spheres.\n",
    "    * <i>Step 2:</i> Identifying the clusters of spheres close together, to identify pockets, and to remove clusters of poor interest.\n",
    "    * <i>Step 3:</i> calculates properties from the atoms of the pocket, in order to score each pocket.\n",

    "          \n",
    "* **DogSiteScorer :**  Several geometric and physico-chemical properties are automatically calculated for the predicted pockets and subpockets. Pocket volume and surface are calculated by counting the **grid points** constituting the pocket volume or its surface and multiplying this number with the grid box volume or surface, respectively. A **breadth-first search** is used for pocket depth computation, starting from the solvent exposed pocket parts toward the most deeply buried regions. (!!grid based method)\n",

    " All 3 algorithms predict pockets solely based on the **atomic co-ordinates** of the protein.\n",
    " * **SiteMap** uses **van der Waals (VdW) energies** and a **buriedness value** calculated on a grid to predict pockets on the protein surface.\n",
    " * **Fpocket** investigates **Î± spheres** for active site predictions.\n",
    " * In **DoGsiteScorer** , pockets and subpockets are predicted with DoGSite using a Difference of **Gaussian filter**.\n"
