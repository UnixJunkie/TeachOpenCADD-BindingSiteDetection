    "_The ultimate goal in pharmaceutical research is to find a novel drug against a specific disease._\n",
    "Structure-based approaches in drug design develop drugs with respect to a target protein which is associated with the disease under investigation. However, in order to develop such a drug it is crucial to know where the drug is supposed to bind the protein and e.g. inhibit or activate the protein. Not always such a small molecule binding site is known, therefore it is important to have tools for binding site detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pocket detection has a special mention in the process of drug prediction. Pockets are a **hollow 3 dimensional space** on the surface of a protein molecule, which serves as the region for **ligand**, **peptide**, or **protein** binding. \n",
    "There are various factors which determine the presence of a pocket in 3 dimensional space in a protein:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The shape (and the molecular orientation) of the region\n",
    "* The possible interactions in a region such as\n",
    "    * Van der Waals forces\n",

    "    * (London dispersion forces)\n",
    "    * (Covalent interaction)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Sometimes ligand information is available (protein-ligand-complex), in that case usually the ligand-surrounding protein region is defined as pocket (e.g. using a 6 A radius).\n",

    "* <i>Step 2:</i> Identifying the clusters of spheres close together, to identify pockets, and to remove clusters of poor interest.\n",
