    "\n",
    "The main objective of a pharmaceutical research is to find a new drug inorder to cure a specific disease. Structure-based approaches in drug design, develop drugs with respect to a target protein which is associated with the disease under investigation. However, in order to develop such a drug it is crucial to know where the drug is supposed to bind in the protein and therefore inhibit or activate the protein. Not always such a small molecule binding site is known and therefore it is important to have tools for binding site detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pocket detection has a special mention in the process of drug prediction. Pockets are a **hollow 3 dimensional space** on the surface of a protein molecule, which serves as the region for **ligand**, **peptide**, or **protein** binding. There are various factors which determine the presence of pocket in 3 dimensional space of a protein:\n",

    "\n",
    "Several geometric and physico-chemical properties are automatically calculated for the predicted pockets and subpockets. In **DogSiteScorer** , pockets and subpockets are predicted with DoGSite using a Difference of **Gaussian filter**. DogSiteScorer falls under the category of the grid based approaches.Pocket volume and surface are calculated by counting the **grid points** constituting the pocket volume or its surface and multiplying this number with the grid box volume or surface, respectively. A **breadth-first search** is used for pocket depth computation, starting from the solvent exposed pocket parts toward the most deeply buried regions. \n",

    "   * The chosen protein is spanned around with a grid of co-ordinates.\n",
    "   * Each of the **grid points** are **labelled**.\n",
    "   * Difference of **Gaussian filter** is applied across the grid.\n",
    "   * This operation helps to find the position on a protein surface where the location of a **sphere-like object** is favorable.\n",
    "   * The last step is neighbouring subpockets are merged to the pockets.\n",

    "* Druggability score:\n",

    "    * This model showed a mean accuracy of 90%.\n",
    "    * The druggabilty score lies between 0 and 1. The higher the score the better the chance that the pocket is druggable.\n",
